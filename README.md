# library-system-spt

To use the files found here, you will need to have an installation of PHP, PHPMyAdmin, and MySQL on your computer. 
We used XAMPP for a local server setting.

If using XAMPP, navigate to its installation folder on your computer.

Once there, place the SPTLibraryProject directory(folder) into the htdocs directory.
Then, place the library_mgmt_db folder into the /mysql/data directory.
Finally, extract the files from MySQL Data Files.zip. There should be three files. Copy them into the /mysql/data directory,
  replacing any files of the same name in the destination folder.
